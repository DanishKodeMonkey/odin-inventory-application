# Inventory management application

## A prototype of a inventory management application using node, express, and mongoDB

This is a prototype inventory management application created as an exercise in the utilisation of node.js express, mongodb, and various middleware.

In essence, it is a project aimed to solidify the knowledge gained during various courses in the subject of creating a full stack application, offering a tool to present various items and categories of items to the user, as well as providing the tools to add and remove items and categories on the go.

### A learning experience

This is a great exercise in the management of resources and keeping alot of moving parts together, as well as developing in a goal oriented manner, not taking on too many tasks at once, and reaching a end-product bit by bit.

Thanks to a solid seperation of concerns, various controllers, schemas, and models are modulated to provide easy to approach debugging as needed, and a pretty setup of the project.
The importance of such practice as a application scales and becomes large, is not missed on me.

### How does it work?

The odin inventory management application, TOIMA? Is a simple prototype that presents the user with data stored in a mongoDB backend, leveraging the powerful tools of node.js and express, as well as various middleware, to present the inventory in stock (fictionally) to the user, and allowing said user to store, delete and edit any item and category at will.
